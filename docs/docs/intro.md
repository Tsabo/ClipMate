# Introducing ClipMate

Welcome to ClipMate, one of the most powerful and useful clipboard utilities ever created.

## It's a Multi-Clipboard

ClipMate enhances the Windows clipboard, transforming it into a true power tool. The standard Windows cut/copy/paste functionality works well for transferring single items of data, but falls short when you need to move multiple pieces of data or retain information beyond your next cut or copy operation. Windows overwrites the clipboard contents whether you're ready or not.

ClipMate works alongside the regular Windows clipboard and remembers every piece of data—both text and graphics—that you cut or copy. Once your data is saved in ClipMate, you can select an item and it's automatically placed back on the clipboard or directly into an application. Within ClipMate you can view, print, edit, reformat, convert case, search, rename, and reorder clip items.

Several "heavy lifting" features such as PowerPaste, Templates, and Text Clean-Up help with big data conversion chores including:
- Contact and lead management
- Data acquisition
- Document assembly
- Research compilation

## It's a Screen Capture Tool

ClipMate's screen capture functions supplement Windows screen capture by adding region and object capture capability with dual-monitor support. You can save, print, or export your screen captures to a variety of formats.

## It's an Organizer

You can create an unlimited number of collections to store your data, with full control over retention rules so your collections fit your personal work process. Many users keep their most-commonly used data in a "Safe" collection, while others organize by topic, project, or source.

ClipMate can hold tens of thousands of items, and its SQL-based search engine finds them quickly. Even if you choose to do nothing special with your clips, you'll always have recent clips at your disposal, ready to paste wherever you need them.

## And More!

ClipMate is also a great:
- Stand-alone spell checker
- Text editor and note-taker
- Email reformatter
- HTML editor
- Encryption utility
- Format stripper

Its network capabilities make it an excellent solution for workgroup repositories such as help desk and call center databases. It has broad applications in virtually every conceivable industry, profession, or hobby.

If you find yourself typing something that you've read or typed at your computer before, ClipMate is ready to help. With ClipMate as your Windows companion, you'll transform the familiar underpowered clipboard into an unexpectedly powerful time saver.
