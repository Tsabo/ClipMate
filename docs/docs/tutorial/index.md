# Tutorial

Welcome! This tutorial will familiarize you with basic ClipMate operation so you can be productive quickly.

## Getting Started

We'll use **ClipMate Classic** for the first few lessons. It closely resembles previous versions of ClipMate and takes up less space than Explorer.

### ClipMate Classic Features

- Menu bar
- Toolbar
- Drop-down ClipList
- Preview/edit window

:::tip ClipBar Alternative
The ClipBar (embedded in the Windows taskbar) has all the capability of ClipMate Classic—it's actually Classic split into two pieces. You can use ClipBar for this tutorial if you prefer.
:::

### Switching to Classic View

If you're in ClipMate Explorer (3-pane layout), switch to Classic:
- **Menu:** View > Open ClipMate Classic
- **Keyboard:** Ctrl+E
- **Toolbar:** Click the Classic/Explorer toggle button

You can switch between Classic and Explorer anytime with **Ctrl+E**.

## The ClipList

The drop-down list at the bottom shows captured items. Click the button at the far right to expand it and see all clip titles.

If you're new, the list may be empty—let's get some data!
