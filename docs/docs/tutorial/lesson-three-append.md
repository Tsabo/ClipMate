# Lesson 3: Append (Glue)

Append lets you combine several text items into one clip. It's handy for gathering items to paste into your word processor as a block.

## Exercise: Append After the Fact

1. Open **ClipMate Explorer** (press **Ctrl+E** if in Classic)
2. Find the ClipList on the right side
3. Hold **Ctrl** and click on Apple, Banana, Chicken Parmesan, Doughnut, Egg
   - Work from bottom to top for the right order
4. Press the **Append button** on the toolbar
5. A new item appears: "Append: (5 Items)"
6. In Notepad, do **File > New** to clear, then paste
7. All 5 items appear as one block of text!

:::tip Space Saver
If Explorer is too large, press **Ctrl+E** to return to Classic, or minimize Explorer.

## Auto-Append Mode

You can also append continuously as you copy:

1. Press the **Append button** without selecting multiple items first
2. Every new copy is appended to a growing clip
3. Press **Append** again to stop

### Audio Feedback

When in Auto-Append mode, you'll hear a different "pop" sound than normal capturing, letting you know appending is active.
