# Lesson 5: Editing

Sometimes clips need fixing before they're ready to paste. You could paste into an editor, modify, and copy back—but ClipMate has a powerful built-in editor!

## Getting Started

1. If in ClipMate Classic, switch to **Explorer** (press toggle button or **Ctrl+E**)
2. Explorer shows 3 panes:
   - **Collection Tree** (left)
   - **ClipList** (upper-right)
   - **Preview/Edit pane** (lower-right)

## 5.1 Creating New Text Clips

You can create clips from scratch:

1. Click the **New Clip** button in the editor toolbar
2. Type or paste your content
3. The clip is saved automatically

## 5.2 The Editor Toolbar

The editor toolbar provides powerful text manipulation:

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Cut/Copy/Paste** | Standard clipboard operations |
| **Undo** | Reverse last edit |
| **Find/Replace** | Search and replace text |
| **Change Case** | Upper, lower, title case |
| **Shift Left/Right** | Adjust indentation |
| **Trim** | Remove whitespace |
| **Remove Line Breaks** | Join lines |

## 5.3 Text Clean-Up

Common cleanup tasks:
- Remove extra line breaks from copied web text
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace
- Change case for consistency
- Find and replace unwanted characters

## 5.4 Advanced Editing

- **Rectangular Selection** — Hold **Alt** while dragging for column selection
- **Spell Check** — Check spelling before pasting
- **Encrypt/Decrypt** — Protect sensitive data

## Tips

Right-click in the editor to show/hide the toolbar. In Classic view, the toolbar may be hidden by default to save space.
