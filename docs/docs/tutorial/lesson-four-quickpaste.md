# Lesson 4: QuickPaste

QuickPaste lets you quickly access frequently-used clips without leaving your current application. Unlike PowerPaste (for sequential pasting), QuickPaste is ad-hoc—pick and choose items in any order.

## Use Case: Online Shopping

Imagine filling out forms on different online stores. Each asks for information in a different order—some want shipping address first, some last. PowerPaste won't help here, but QuickPaste handles it perfectly!

:::tip Navigation
QuickPaste is built on ClipMate Classic. Press **Ctrl+E** to switch from Explorer to Classic for smoother QuickPasting.

## Exercise: QuickPaste

First, copy these items into ClipMate:

```
(716) 555-1212
(716) 555-1234
1234123412341234
1203
John Doe
123 Main Street
Anytown
NY
12345
USA
johndoe@anyisp.net
```

### Steps

1. Open **Notepad** and type a few characters to position the cursor
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Q** — ClipMate opens in QuickPaste mode
3. Notice the **target icon** in the status bar showing "Notepad"
4. Select **"John Doe"** using mouse or arrow keys
5. Press **Enter** — the data pastes into Notepad and you return there

You've done a QuickPaste!

### Try More

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Q** again
2. Select the street address
3. Press **Enter** — another QuickPaste!

4. Press **Ctrl+Shift+Q** again
5. **Double-click** the credit card number — same result!

Go through the rest in random order. Notice that each time you open QuickPaste, the last item is already highlighted—useful for repeat pasting.

## Advanced QuickPaste Features

- **Two Collections** — View two collections at once, tab between them
- **Format Strings** — Append timestamp, title, or URL when pasting
