# Lesson 1: Basic Operation

Let's learn how ClipMate captures and retrieves clipboard data.

## Exercise: Copying Data

One at a time, highlight each line below with your mouse and press **Ctrl+C** to copy:

```
Apple
Banana
Chicken Parmesan
Doughnut
Egg
```

If you have ClipMate's sounds enabled, you'll hear little "pops" as you copy each item.

## What You Should See

After copying all five items, ClipMate should display "Egg" in the drop-down list (the last item copied).

**Pull down the list** — you should see ALL the items you copied!

:::tip The Key Difference
This is where ClipMate differs from the standard Windows clipboard. The regular clipboard only shows the last item copied, but **ClipMate has them all**.

## Exercise: Pasting Data

1. Open **Notepad** (Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad)
2. Paste using **Edit > Paste** or **Ctrl+V**
3. You get "Egg" — no surprise, that's what's on the clipboard

Now try this:
1. In ClipMate's ClipList, click on **"Apple"**
2. Go back to Notepad and paste again (**Ctrl+V**)
3. You get **"Apple"**!

Repeat for all 5 items. You can access any previous clip at any time.

## Key Takeaways

- ClipMate automatically captures everything you copy
- Select any clip from the ClipList to put it back on the clipboard
- Paste as usual with Ctrl+V
