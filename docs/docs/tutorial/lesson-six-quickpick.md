# Lesson 6: QuickPick

QuickPick filters clips by typing text that appears in the title. With 500 clips in your InBox, finding one with "Enron" in the title is instant—just type!

## Exercise: Using QuickPick

Using the clips from Lesson 4 in ClipMate Classic:

1. Click the **drop-down arrow** to expose the ClipList
2. Type: `?john`

As you type:
- The `?` triggers QuickPick mode (blue bar appears)
- By the time you type "jo", matching clips move to the top

## How It Works

- Your typing appears in the status bar with a "hand" icon
- **Backspace** removes characters
- **Escape** exits QuickPick mode
- Erasing all characters also exits QuickPick

## QuickPick Features

:::note Search Behavior
- **Not case sensitive** — "John" and "john" match the same
- **Searches titles only** — Not the clip body
- **Matches anywhere** — Not just the beginning of titles
:::

## New Clips During QuickPick

Any clips captured while filtering appear **below** the blue bar. They're at the top of the collection but not part of the filtered results.

## Tips

QuickPick is great for:
- Finding clips quickly without full search
- Navigating large collections
- Rapid clip selection
