# Visual Options

{/* ![Visual Options Tab](img/options-visual.png) */}

The Visual tab controls the appearance and display behavior of ClipMate.

## Display Options

### Show Item Type Icons

Show or hide the indicator icons to the left of clip titles in the ClipList. See [Item Type Icons](../user-interface/cliplist/item-type-icons.md).

### Use Fancy Menus and Buttons

ClipMate normally shows icons in its menus and buttons. Turn this off if you:
- Prefer a simpler look
- Are visually impaired and use a screen reader

### Magnetic Borders

When positioning windows near screen edges, this causes them to "snap" to the edge when within 16 pixels. This makes it easy to align to corners and edges (sometimes called "WinAmp" style).

## Skins

ClipMate features "skins" that change its appearance and add functionality, including an extra title bar button for "stay on top" toggling.

:::note Compatibility
If you use another skinning program like WindowBlinds:
- Don't use skins within ClipMate, OR
- Disable ClipMate skinning within WindowBlinds
:::

### Skin Options

- **Skin the titlebar/menu** - Turn off if another program adds buttons to the toolbar
- **3-button skins** - Skins starting with "3_" don't have the extra 4th button

ClipMate uses VCLSkin library skins, customized for ClipMate. Check the website for new skins.

:::tip Missing Skins?
If skins aren't available, you may have skipped them during installation. Re-install and select "full install."
