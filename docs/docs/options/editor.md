# Editor Options

These options apply to the Preview/Edit window. You can also show/hide the toolbar by right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Show Toolbar."

## Display Options

### Show Line Numbers

Display line numbers along the left side of the editor. This is:
- Only available when viewing TEXT clips
- Only visible when the toolbar is showing

### Enable Binary View

Enables the Binary tab for examining raw clip data. Useful for:
- Checking if there's a carriage return AND line feed, or just line feed
- Examining headers in HTML clips
- Investigating data format issues

### Smooth Scrolling

Choose between smooth scrolling or jump scrolling behavior.

## Tab Stops

If data copied from another editor assumes different tab stop settings, it may look odd in ClipMate. Adjust tab stops to match your needs (4, 5, 8, 10 spaces, etc.).

:::note
This setting does NOT affect the actual data—only how it displays within ClipMate.

## Clip Titles

### Automatically Change Clip Titles

By default, clip titles are created from the first 50 characters of text content. This setting controls whether the title updates when you edit a clip.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Enabled** | Title updates automatically when clip content changes |
| **Disabled** | Title stays as originally captured |

:::note Manual Titles Stick
If you manually rename a clip using the Rename Title command, that title will "stick" and won't be automatically updated regardless of this setting.
:::

## Default Editor View

New clips normally open showing the "Text" tab. You can select a different default tab for viewing new clips.
