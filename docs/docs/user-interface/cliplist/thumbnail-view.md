# Thumbnail View

Thumbnail View displays clips as graphic thumbnails, giving you a visual preview of each clip's contents.

## Switching Views

Click the View Mode button at the far right of the ClipMate Explorer toolbar to switch between Thumbnail View and Detail View.

## What You'll See

Thumbnail View shows:
- **Bitmap clips** - Actual image preview
- **Text clips** - Text rendered as a graphic preview
- **Rich Text clips** - Formatted text preview
- **HTML clips** - Rendered HTML preview

## When to Use Thumbnail View

Thumbnail View is especially useful when:
- Working with screenshots and images
- Quickly identifying clips by visual content
- Browsing a collection with mixed content types

## Thumbnail Size

You can adjust the thumbnail size to show more or fewer clips at once. Larger thumbnails show more detail; smaller thumbnails let you see more clips.

## Limitations

Thumbnail View may not be as efficient as Detail View when:
- Working with large collections
- You need to see detailed metadata (date, source, etc.)
- Quick sorting and filtering is more important than visual preview
