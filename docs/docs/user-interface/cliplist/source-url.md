# Source URL

When copying from web browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.), the URL of the page that the data was copied from is recorded in the **Source URL** field.

## Viewing Source URLs

In ClipMate Explorer, you can click on the URL to launch the page in your default browser.

You can also right-click on a clip and select **"Open Source URL in Browser"**, which is handy if you're in Traditional View and would otherwise have to scroll excessively.

## Copy Source URL to Clipboard

You can place the source URL onto the clipboard by itself:

1. Right-click on a clip
2. Select **"Place Source URL on Clipboard"**

The URL will be placed onto the system clipboard, ready for you to paste into a document.

:::note
The copied URL will NOT be re-captured by ClipMate (to avoid clutter).
