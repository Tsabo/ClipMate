# The User Interface

ClipMate has two main windows—ClipMate Classic and ClipMate Explorer—plus the ClipBar which integrates into the Windows taskbar. Each interface is designed for different usage scenarios, and you can easily switch between them.

## ClipMate Classic

ClipMate Classic is essentially a toolbar with a drop-down list of clips and a preview area. It's intended for quick access to your data and takes up much less screen space than Explorer. The interface closely resembles earlier versions of ClipMate.

## ClipMate Explorer

ClipMate Explorer features a three-pane interface similar to Windows Explorer, with a Collection Tree on the left, ClipList on the right, and Preview/Edit pane below. It's intended for heavy-duty editing and organization of your clips.

## ClipBar

The ClipBar integrates directly into the Windows taskbar, showing the current clip and providing toolbar buttons for common operations. It gives you quick access to ClipMate functionality without taking up desktop space.
