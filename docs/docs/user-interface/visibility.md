# Visibility: On-Top and Auto-Hide

ClipMate Classic, Explorer, and floating editor windows can all be displayed in three visibility modes that control how the window behaves when ClipMate loses focus.

## Visibility Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Always On-Top** | Window stays above other windows, even when other apps have focus |
| **Auto-Hide** | Window minimizes or hides when focus moves to another application |
| **Normal** | Window behaves like any other program, obscured by overlapping windows |

## Setting Visibility

You can set the visibility mode from:
- **View** menu
- **System menu** (click the icon in the upper-left corner of the window)
- **Titlebar button** (4th button if using window skins)

## Per-Window Settings

Each window retains its own visibility setting:
- ClipMate Explorer can have one setting
- ClipMate Classic can have another
- Floating editors have their own settings

:::caution Be careful with Explorer
Due to its larger size, Explorer set to "always on-top" can sometimes obscure message boxes and dialogs from other applications.
:::

## Transparency

The Transparency setting allows other windows to show through the ClipMate window when it's set to "always on top." This uses a technique called **alpha blending**.

Access Transparency from:
- **System Menu** > **Transparency**
- **View** menu > **Transparency**
