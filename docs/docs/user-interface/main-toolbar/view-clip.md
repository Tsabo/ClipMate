# 👁️ View Clip

{/* ![View Clip Button](img/toolbar-view-clip.png) */}

Opens a floating Preview/Edit window for the selected clip. This allows you to view or edit a clip in a separate, resizable window.

## Usage

## Alternative Access

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Keyboard | **F2** from within Classic or Explorer |
| Menu | **View → View Clip** |
| Hotkey | Configurable global hotkey |

## Benefits

A floating editor window is helpful when:
- You need more space for heavy-duty editing
- You want to see clipboard contents without cluttering your screen
- The embedded editor in Classic is too small
- You want to compare clips side by side

## Window Features

The floating editor window:
- Can be resized and maximized
- Includes the same tabs as the embedded editor (Text, Rich Text, Bitmap, HTML, Binary)
- Has its own toolbar for editing operations
- Can be closed with **ESC** when finished
