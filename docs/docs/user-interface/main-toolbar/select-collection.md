# 📁 Select Collection

Switches to a different collection, loading its clips into the ClipList. This is another split button like Move/Copy.

## Usage

### Drop-Down Arrow
Click the arrow to see a menu of available collections. Select one to load it.

### Icon Button
Click the icon to advance to the next collection in the tree (if this option is enabled in **Options → General**).

The icon represents the currently loaded collection.

## Alternative Methods

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Collection Tree | Click any collection in Explorer's Collection Tree |
| Keyboard | Use arrow keys in the Collection Tree |

## Same As Collection Tree

Selecting a collection from this button is identical to clicking on a collection in the Explorer's Collection Tree. This button provides quick access when using ClipMate Classic or when the Collection Tree isn't visible.
