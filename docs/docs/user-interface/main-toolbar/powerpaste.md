# PowerPaste Button

The PowerPaste button activates ClipMate's powerful batch pasting feature. Once activated, PowerPaste automatically advances to the next clip each time you paste, allowing you to rapidly paste a series of items.

## Button States

The PowerPaste button has visual indicators showing its state:

| State | Appearance | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Off | No arrow | PowerPaste is inactive |
| Up | Arrow pointing up | Will paste upward through the ClipList |
| Down | Arrow pointing down | Will paste downward through the ClipList |

## Usage

1. Select the starting clip in your series
2. Click the PowerPaste button once to activate (arrow appears)
3. If the arrow points the wrong direction, click again to flip it
4. Switch to your target application
5. Paste repeatedly—ClipMate advances after each paste
6. Click the button again to turn off PowerPaste

## Arrow Behavior

- First click shows the arrow in the direction you last used
- If you paste and click the button, PowerPaste turns off
- If you click without pasting, the arrow flips direction
- The direction is remembered between sessions
