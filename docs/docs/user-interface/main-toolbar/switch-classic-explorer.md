# Switch Classic / Explorer

This button toggles between ClipMate Classic and ClipMate Explorer views.

## Usage

Click the button to switch to the other view:
- If you're in Classic, it switches to Explorer
- If you're in Explorer, it switches to Classic

## Alternative Access

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Keyboard | **Ctrl+E** |
| Menu | **View → Open ClipMate Classic** or **View → Open ClipMate Explorer** |

## Loading Behavior

If the target view is already loaded in the background, the switch happens instantly. Otherwise, there's a brief delay while the window is constructed and populated.

To ensure fast switching, you can pre-load both interfaces at startup:
1. Go to **Options → General → Startup**
2. Enable **Load Explorer at Startup** and **Load Classic at Startup**
