# Preview/Edit Window

The Preview/Edit Pane is where you can view clips and, if they're text items, edit and reformat them. There are up to 6 tabs at the bottom of the pane to display various formats of data:

- **TEXT** - Plain text, fully editable
- **Rich Text** - Rich Text Format (view only)
- **Bitmap** - Bitmap images
- **Picture** - Metafile/vector images
- **HTML** - Web content
- **Binary** - Raw hex data

Not all tabs are present for every clip—only the ones applicable to the data contained within the clip are displayed.

## Docked and Floating Modes

The Preview/Edit Window can be:
- **Docked** into ClipMate Explorer or ClipMate Classic
- **Floating** as a free-standing window

Floating editor windows are helpful when you want to:
- Do heavy-duty editing on a particular clip
- See current clipboard contents without cluttering your screen
- View clips at a larger size

To open a floating editor:
- Click the **View Clip** button
- Select **View** > **View Clip** from the menu
- Press **F2** from within Classic or Explorer

## Editor Toolbar

The text editor has a powerful toolbar with many editing functions. Due to space constraints, the toolbar may be hidden when docked into ClipMate Classic.

To toggle the toolbar:
1. Right-click within the editor pane
2. Select the option to show/hide the toolbar

To customize the toolbar:
1. Right-click on a button or blank space
2. Select **Customize** from the menu
3. Choose large or small button sets
