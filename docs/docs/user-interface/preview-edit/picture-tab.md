# Picture Tab

The Picture Tab displays Picture (Metafile) image clips. Metafiles contain vector graphics rather than pixel-based bitmap data.

## What Is Picture/Metafile Data?

Picture data is typically used for:
- Mechanical drawings
- Clip art
- Diagrams and charts
- Other vector graphics

Vector graphics look good when stretched or resized because they're defined mathematically rather than as pixels.

## When to Use

Picture format is **not suitable** for:
- Photographs
- Screenshots
- Real-life images

These are better represented as Bitmap data.

## Viewing

The Picture Tab displays the metafile at its natural size within the available space. Unlike bitmaps, vector images can be scaled without losing quality.
