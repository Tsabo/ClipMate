# Rich Text Tab

The Rich Text Tab displays clips that contain Rich Text Format (RTF) data. RTF is used by word processors and contains formatting information such as fonts, colors, alignment, and styles.

## View Only

ClipMate can **display** Rich Text data in this tab but **cannot edit** it. The formatting is preserved exactly as it was captured.

## When RTF Data Appears

Rich Text Format data is typically captured when copying from:
- Microsoft Word
- WordPad
- LibreOffice Writer
- Other word processors
- Rich text editors

## What You'll See

The Rich Text Tab shows the formatted text with:
- Fonts and font sizes
- Bold, italic, underline styles
- Text colors and highlighting
- Paragraph alignment
- Bulleted and numbered lists
- Tables (depending on source)
